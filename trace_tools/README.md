# trace_tools

Experiments for logging, parsing, and interpreting agent execution traces.

Goals:
- Build a trace format that can be reused across different agent systems
- Allow step-by-step playback and failure diagnosis
- Visualize divergence points, retry paths, and memory injection

This folder contains early scaffolding. Not production-ready.
