# prompt_lab

A place to experiment with structured prompts, branching instructions, and input layering.

Ideas:
- use YAML to define prompt sequences
- track how small rewrites change agent behavior
- test prompt reusability across different agent roles

Not sure yet how this fits into the full system â€” just exploring.
